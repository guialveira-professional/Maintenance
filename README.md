# General 
Hello, this is my Technical Challenge submission, It is a pleasure to meet you.
Let me explain the files here to you:

* `Challenge_code.ipynb` : Here is the notebook where I extract,treat and analise the provided Datasets and build a machine learning model to solve the proposed challenge. Here you will also see my answers to the questions in the document sent to me and my calculations for the plataform test.
* `air_system_present_year.csv` and  `air_system_previous_years.csv` : are the datasets provided to me.
* `requirements.txt` : This is to help you set up your environment exactly like mine.

# Problematic

In this Challenge was proposed a scenario based on a maintenance area, this subject is complex and hard to deal because of the variable numbers. Happily I love challenges :smile: !
It was given to me 2 datasets totally unbalanced and with a lot of missing data, furthermore the company has just passed through a digitalization process where data might be lost. 
I also used some maintenance knowledge to get some conclusions, a data scientist must know about business. Everything is explained in the notebook markdowns.
Here is what I used:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scipy
* Scikit-learn
* Statistics Analisys
* Random Forest Classifier
* Hyperparameters Tunning
* Model evaluation

# Final Remarks

I appreciate your time looking into my code and the opportunity to solve this challenge, it was really fun and challenging.
I'd love some tips or advices, so please be free to contact me in Linkedin, It will be a pleasure : `https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-alves-de-oliveira-914149258/`
