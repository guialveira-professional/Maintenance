# General 

* `Challenge_code.ipynb` : Here is the notebook where I extract,treat and analise the provided Datasets and build a machine learning model.
* `air_system_present_year.csv` and  `air_system_previous_years.csv` : are the datasets.
* `requirements.txt` : This is to help you set up your environment exactly like mine.

# Problematic

The scenario is based on a maintenance area, this subject is complex and hard to deal because of the variable numbers.
It was given 2 datasets totally unbalanced and with a lot of missing data, furthermore the company has just passed through a digitalization process where data might be lost. 
I also used some maintenance knowledge to get some conclusions. Everything is explained in the notebook markdowns.
Here is what I used:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scipy
* Scikit-learn
* Statistics Analisys
* Random Forest Classifier
* Hyperparameters Tunning
* Model evaluation
